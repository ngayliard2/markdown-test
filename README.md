# Predicting tomorrow's rainfall in Australia

## Executive summary

The goal of this analysis is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in a given city in Australia, based on today's weather. We analyzed a Kaggle dataset of daily weather data collected in 49 Australian cities between 2010 and 2018. The final model had an 83.9% accuracy rate in predicting whether or not it would rain tomorrow vs. a baseline model accuracy of 77.8%.

## Introduction

### Problem statement

Our goal is to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow, in a given city in Australia, based on today's weather, using replicable machine learning techniques. We used two separate modeling techniques (Decision Tree and Random Forest) to create these forecasts.

### Dataset

The analysis is based on this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) of **daily weather data** collected in 49 Australian cities between 2010 and 2018. *The dataset consists of 22 numerical and categorical features, and 1 target classification variable.*
